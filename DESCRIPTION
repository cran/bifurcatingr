Description: Estimation of bifurcating autoregressive models of any order, p, BAR(p) as
    well as several types of bias correction for the least squares estimators of
    the autoregressive parameters as described in Zhou and Basawa (2005)
    <doi:10.1016/j.spl.2005.04.024> and Elbayoumi and Mostafa (2020)
    <doi:10.1002/sta4.342>. Currently, the bias correction methods supported
    include bootstrap (single, double and fast-double) bias correction and
    linear-bias-function-based bias correction. Functions for generating and
    plotting bifurcating autoregressive data from any BAR(p) model are also
    included.
